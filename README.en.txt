===== RECOMMENDED WAYS TO MAKE CHANGES =====

Scores need to change in the administrative panel of site (http://адрес_сайта/admin/), section Scoring.

To change the templates and css styles - it is recommended to create a copy of the file (and subdirectories if required) in the catalog custom.
Files of custom directory will take precedence over the original files, and because the original files will be untouched. This makes it easier to update statistics on a new version.

After making changes in css styles, images, templates - is needed to run a command collectstatic to rebuild  static files.
